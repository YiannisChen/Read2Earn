# Ten Principles of Economics

### Introduction
- Economics = study of how society manages scarce resources
- Word "economy" from Greek "oikonomos" (household manager)

### How People Make Decisions
1. **People Face Trade-offs**
   - Can't have everything - always giving up something
   - Society examples: guns vs. butter, environment vs. economy, efficiency vs. equality

2. **Cost = What You Give Up**
   - Opportunity cost matters
   - College costs include time you could've earned money
   
3. **Thinking at the Margin**
   - Decisions made at the incremental level
   - Is ONE more unit worth it?
   - Explains water-diamond paradox

4. **People Respond to Incentives**
   - Change cost/benefit → change behavior
   - Example: Seat belts → safer but more careless driving

### How People Interact
5. **Trade Makes Everyone Better Off**
   - Not zero-sum, creates value through specialization
   - Countries benefit from trade just like families do

6. **Markets Usually Work Well**
   - Decentralized decisions often better than central planning
   - "Invisible hand" guides self-interest toward social benefit
   - Prices coordinate buyers and sellers

7. **Government Can Sometimes Help Markets**
   - Needed for: property rights, externalities (pollution), market power
   - Can also promote equality
   - But government policies aren't always perfect

### How the Economy Works
8. **Living Standards Depend on Productivity**
   - Productivity = goods/services per worker
   - Why some countries are rich and others poor
   - Growth requires education, tools, technology

9. **Inflation Caused by Printing Too Much Money**
   - Money growth → price growth
   - Germany 1920s = extreme example

10. **Inflation-Unemployment Trade-off (Short Run)**
    - More money → more spending → more hiring (initially)
    - But eventually → just higher prices
    - Creates business cycle
