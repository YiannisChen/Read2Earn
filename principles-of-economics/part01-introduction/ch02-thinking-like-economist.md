# Thinking Like an Economist

## Intro
* Every field has its own language and thinking approach
* Economics uses specialized terms and models

## The Economist as Scientist

### Scientific Method
* Observation → theory → more observation
* Can't run controlled experiments easily
* Study "natural experiments" from history

### Assumptions
* Simplify complex problems
* Example: Two countries, two goods for trade analysis
* Different questions need different assumptions

### Economic Models
1. **Circular-Flow Diagram**
   * Shows money flow between households and firms
   * Two markets: goods/services and factors of production
   * Households buy goods, sell labor
   * Firms sell goods, buy labor

2. **Production Possibilities Frontier**
   * Graph showing what economy can produce with available resources
   * Points on frontier = efficient
   * Points inside = inefficient
   * Points outside = unattainable
   * Shows trade-offs and opportunity costs
   * Shifts outward with economic growth

### Micro vs. Macro
* **Microeconomics** = individual decisions and specific markets
* **Macroeconomics** = economy-wide issues (inflation, unemployment)
* Connected - macro outcomes emerge from micro decisions

## The Economist as Policy Adviser

### Positive vs. Normative
* **Positive statements**: How world IS (can be tested)
   * "Minimum wage increases unemployment"
* **Normative statements**: How world SHOULD BE (values-based)
   * "Government should raise minimum wage"

### Why Economists Disagree
1. Different views on facts/theories
2. Different values/priorities

### Areas of Agreement
* 80%+ economists agree on issues like:
   * Rent control hurts housing availability
   * Trade barriers reduce economic welfare
   * Markets better than central planning
