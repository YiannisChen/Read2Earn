# My Chapter 1 Problem Solutions


## 10. Healthcare statements:

**a. "Best healthcare for everyone":**
- Equality view: Healthcare as right for all
- Efficiency problem: Would cost insane amounts of money
- Nice idea, hard to actually do

**b. "Unemployment benefits until new job":**
- Equality view: Help people in tough times
- Efficiency problem: Why take a job if benefits are good?
- Depends how much you trust people to actually want to work

## 11. Better living standards:

We're better off than our parents because:
- Better technology (productivity)
- More education
- More machines/computers/tools
- Trade lets us get stuff cheaper
- Still some people left behind though

## 12. Saving and productivity:

- More savings = more money for businesses
- Businesses buy cool machines and tech
- Workers can make more stuff per hour
- Everyone gets more stuff and higher wages
- Not really a free lunch though - have to consume less now to get more later

## 13. Healthcare reform:

**a. Equality/efficiency balance:**
- Equality: Getting more people insured
- Efficiency: Trying to make healthcare less wasteful
- Mixed bag really

**b. Productivity effects:**
- Might help: Healthier workers, people can switch jobs without losing insurance
- Might hurt: Higher taxes = less incentive to work hard

**c. If costs increase:**
- Bad for business = less hiring
- Companies might cut other benefits to compensate
- More part-time workers to avoid insurance requirements

## 14. Revolutionary War money printing:

- Their money became worth less
- Government basically took value from citizens sneakily
- Kind of like a hidden tax that mostly hit ordinary people

## 15. Inflation reduction decision:

Need to know:
- Fighting inflation usually means higher interest rates
- Higher rates = more unemployment temporarily
- Trade-off between price stability and jobs
- No free lunch in economics (as usual)

## 16. Airport financing:

**Taxes:**
- Short-term: People have less money to spend
- Long-term: Stable prices but maybe slower growth

**Printing money:**
- Short-term: Stimulates economy, more jobs
- Long-term: Inflation makes everything cost more
