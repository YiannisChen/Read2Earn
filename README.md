# My Reading Notes Repo

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my reading notes collection!

As a CS student, I've realized I seriously lack knowledge about economics. Being honest, this already bit me hard â€” In 2024 I played with leverage in crypto and lost all 200k USD(on 4.14) from Strk airdrops that I worked hard to get... painful lesson! ðŸ¥²

So I've decided to systematically learn economics. Never again do I want to take another lesson because I didn't understand these basic concepts.

## What's Inside

- [Principles of Economics](/principles-of-economics) - Fundamentals of macro and microeconomics ([PDF link](https://renessans-edu.uz/files/books/2023-11-02-04-26-19_73440a247c94a07116bd881b10442047.pdf))
- More books coming soon!

## Why I'm Doing This

1. **Avoiding Costly Mistakes** - Hope to stop losing money due to economic ignorance
2. **Learning in Public** - Putting notes on GitHub keeps me accountable
3. **Cross-Disciplinary Thinking** - As a programmer, understanding economics helps with markets and products

## Coming Up Next

Planning to add notes on:
- Investment basics
- Intro to financial markets
- Monetary policy and personal asset allocation
- ...and other interesting stuff!

## How It's Organized

Each book gets its own folder with:
- A README explaining the core content
- Chapter-by-chapter notes (in markdown)
- Key concepts and personal reflections
