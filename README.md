My Reading Notes Repo
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my reading notes collection!
As a CS student, I've realized I seriously lack knowledge about economics. Being honest, this already bit me hard â€” I recently played with leverage in crypto and lost all 200k USD from airdrops that I worked hard to get... painful lesson! ðŸ¥²
So I've decided to systematically learn economics. Never again do I want to take another lesson because I didn't understand these basic concepts.
What's Inside

Principles of Economics - Fundamentals of macro and microeconomics
More books coming soon!

Why I'm Doing This

Avoiding Costly Mistakes - Hope to stop losing money due to economic ignorance
Learning in Public - Putting notes on GitHub keeps me accountable
Cross-Disciplinary Thinking - As a programmer, understanding economics helps with markets and products

Coming Up Next
Planning to add notes on:

...and other interesting stuff!

How It's Organized
Each book gets its own folder with:

A README explaining the core content
Chapter-by-chapter notes (in markdown)
Key concepts and personal reflections
